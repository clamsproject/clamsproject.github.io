Description
-----------

An annotation over an interval of linear primary data, either a text, a video or audio stream. An Interval may be defined by pointing directly into primary data (by using start and end offsets) or by linking to one or more other Annotations with the targets property. This annotation type is intended to be an abstract type and typically one of the sub types will be used.


Properties
----------


document
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Region_v1*


timeUnit
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** Specifies which unit of time the measurement is based. Can be *seconds* or *milliseconds*, or in case of annotations on a VideoDocument, *frames*.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Region_v1*


start
~~~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The starting offset in the primary data. This point is inclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No


end
~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The ending offset in the primary data. This point is exclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No


targets
~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Description:** IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to *start* and *end* to point to component annotations (for example a token sequence) rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more annotations (for example in a coreference annotation).
- **Required:** No
