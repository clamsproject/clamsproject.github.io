Description
-----------

Any relationship between two or more annotation types. For texts could be a grammatical relation such as subject-object, a semantic relation between meanings or roles, or a temporal relation indicating the simultaneity or ordering in time of events or states. For image regions and video objects this could involve spatial relations or part-whole relations.


Properties
----------


document
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*


labelset
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Description:** When an annotation object contains results of a classification task, this metadata is used to specify the label values used in classification. Individual annotations then must have <code>label</code> property that is one of the values in this list. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or <code> labelsetUri </code> metadata. <br><br> [Note] Not all of labels specified in the <code>labelset</code> must occur in the output annotations. For example, a <code>labelset</code> can contain a <i>catch-all</i> negative label, but if the negative label can be not interesting enough to keep in the output annotation.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*


labelsetUri
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** A URI to an externally defined labelset. Since the <code>labelset</code> metadata is a list of simple strings, this URI can be used to point to a more detailed definition of the labelset. This can be a JSON-LD document or a SKOS concept scheme, for example. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or <code> labelset </code> metadata.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*


label
~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** A label given to this object by classification. The value must be a simple string value of the label and must be one of the values defined in the <code>labelset</code> or <code>labelsetUri</code> annotation metadata. <br><br> For example, for the <code>Sentence</code> subtype, this could be used to indicate the type of sentence, such as "declarative", "interrogative", "exclamatory", etc. For <code>NamedEntity</code> subtype, this could be used to indicate the type of named entity, such as "PER", "ORG", "LOC", "MISC" (following the CoNLL-2003 labels). <br><br> For non-linguistic annotations, for example for <code>TimeFrame<code>, this could be used to indicate the type of the time frame, such as "speech", "music", "noise", "bars-and-tones", etc, for acoustic classification. Or "slate", "lower-third", "credits" for visual classification of video frames. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a type of classifier model must have this property.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*


classifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *object*
- **Description:** Alias for the <code>classification</code> metadata. Here for historical reasons.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*


classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *object*
- **Description:** A map from label values to their "score" numbers provided by a classifier. The score can be probability, similarity, confidence, or any other real number that was used to determine the label value. <br><br> [Optional] on top of the <code>label</code> property. However when this property is used, the <code>label</code> property must be one of the keys and the keys must match to the values defined in the <code>labelset</code> or <code>labelsetUri</code> annotation metadata.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Annotation_v6*
