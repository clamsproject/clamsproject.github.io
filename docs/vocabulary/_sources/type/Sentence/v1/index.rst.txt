Description

Properties
----------


document
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Required:** No

The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


labelset
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Required:** No

When an annotation object contains results of a classification task, this metadata is used to specify the label values used in classification. Individual annotations then must have ``label`` property that is one of the values in this list.

.. note::

   Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or ``labelsetUri`` metadata.

.. note::

   Not all of labels specified in the ``labelset`` must occur in the output annotations. For example, a ``labelset`` can contain a *catch-all* negative label, but if the negative label can be not interesting enough to keep in the output annotation.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


labelsetUri
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Required:** No

A URI to an externally defined labelset. Since the ``labelset`` metadata is a list of simple strings, this URI can be used to point to a more detailed definition of the labelset. This can be a JSON-LD document or a SKOS concept scheme, for example.

.. note::

   Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or ``labelset`` metadata.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


label
~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Required:** No

A label given to this object by classification. The value must be a simple string value of the label and must be one of the values defined in the ``labelset`` or ``labelsetUri`` annotation metadata.

For example, for the ``Sentence`` subtype, this could be used to indicate the type of sentence, such as "declarative", "interrogative", "exclamatory", etc. For ``NamedEntity`` subtype, this could be used to indicate the type of named entity, such as "PER", "ORG", "LOC", "MISC" (following the CoNLL-2003 labels).

For non-linguistic annotations, for example for ``TimeFrame``, this could be used to indicate the type of the time frame, such as "speech", "music", "noise", "bars-and-tones", etc, for acoustic classification. Or "slate", "lower-third", "credits" for visual classification of video frames.

.. note::

   Annotations from a type of classifier model must have this property.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


classifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *object*
- **Required:** No

Alias for the ``classification`` metadata. Here for historical reasons.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


classification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *object*
- **Required:** No

A map from label values to their "score" numbers provided by a classifier. The score can be probability, similarity, confidence, or any other real number that was used to determine the label value.

*Optional* on top of the ``label`` property. However when this property is used, the ``label`` property must be one of the keys and the keys must match to the values defined in the ``labelset`` or ``labelsetUri`` annotation metadata.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


timeUnit
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Required:** No

Specifies which unit of time the measurement is based. Can be *seconds* or *milliseconds*, or in case of annotations on a VideoDocument, *frames*. If not specified, *milliseconds* (in whole numbers) is assumed.

.. note::

   This metadata is only relevant for time-based annotations.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


start
~~~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Required:** No

The starting offset in the primary data. This point is inclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


end
~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Required:** No

The ending offset in the primary data. This point is exclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


targets
~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Required:** No

IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to *start* and *end* to point to component annotations (for example a token sequence) rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more annotations (for example in a coreference annotation).

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*


text
~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Required:** No

The surface string in the primary data covered by this span.

- **Inherited from:** *Span_v5*
