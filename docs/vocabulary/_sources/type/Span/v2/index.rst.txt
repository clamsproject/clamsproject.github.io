Description
-----------

An annotation over a region in primary text data. A Span may be defined by pointing directly into primary data (by using start and end offsets) or by linking to one or more other Annotations with the targets property.


Properties
----------


document
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


labelset
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Description:** When an annotation object contains results of a classification task, this metadata is used to specify the label values used in classification. Individual annotations then must have <code>label</code> property that is one of the values in this list. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or <code> labelsetUri </code> metadata. <br><br> [Note] Not all of labels specified in the <code>labelset</code> must occur in the output annotations. For example, a <code>labelset</code> can contain a <i>catch-all</i> negative label, but if the negative label can be not interesting enough to keep in the output annotation.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


labelsetUri
~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** A URI to an externally defined labelset. Since the <code>labelset</code> metadata is a list of simple strings, this URI can be used to point to a more detailed definition of the labelset. This can be a JSON-LD document or a SKOS concept scheme, for example. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a classifier app must have this metadata or <code> labelset </code> metadata.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


label
~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** A label given to this object by a classifier. The value must be a simple string value of the label and must be one of the values defined in the <code>labelset</code> or <code>labelsetUri</code> annotation metadata. <br><br> [Note] Annotations from a classifier app must have this property.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


classifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *object*
- **Description:** A map from label values to their "score" numbers provided by a classifier. The score can be probability, similarity, confidence, or any other real number that was used to determine the label value. <br><br> [Optional] on top of the <code>label</code> property. However when this property is used, the <code>label</code> property must be one of the keys and the keys must match to the values defined in the <code>labelset</code> or <code>labelsetUri</code> annotation metadata.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


timeUnit
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** Specifies which unit of time the measurement is based. Can be *seconds* or *milliseconds*, or in case of annotations on a VideoDocument, *frames*.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


start
~~~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The starting offset in the primary data. This point is inclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


end
~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The ending offset in the primary data. This point is exclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*


targets
~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Description:** IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to *start* and *end* to point to component annotations (for example a token sequence) rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more annotations (for example in a coreference annotation).
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v2*
