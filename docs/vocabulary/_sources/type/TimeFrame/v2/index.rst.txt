Properties
----------


document
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** The identifier of the document that the annotation is over.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v1*


timeUnit
~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** Specifies which unit of time the measurement is based. Can be *seconds* or *milliseconds*, or in case of annotations on a VideoDocument, *frames*.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v1*


start
~~~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The starting offset in the primary data. This point is inclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v1*


end
~~~

- **Type:** *integer*
- **Description:** The ending offset in the primary data. This point is exclusive. For time intervals, the unit is determined by the *timeUnit* metadata key. For text intervals, the unit is Unicode code point.
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v1*


targets
~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *array of string*
- **Description:** IDs of a sequence of annotations covering the region of primary data referred to by this annotation. Used as an alternative to *start* and *end* to point to component annotations (for example a token sequence) rather than directly into primary data, or to link two or more annotations (for example in a coreference annotation).
- **Required:** No
- **Inherited from:** *Interval_v1*


frameType
~~~~~~~~~

- **Type:** *string*
- **Description:** The type of TimeFrame. Possible values include, but are not limited to, bars, tones, bars-and-tones, speech, noise, music, slate, chyron, lower-third, credits, and other.
- **Required:** No
