Overview
========

Introduction
------------

The CLAMS Vocabulary defines the type system used in the CLAMS project, notably
used for annotating and describing multimedia content in Multi-Media Interchange
Format (MMIF) serialization. It provides:

* **Type Definitions** - Pydantic-based models for annotation and document
  types
* **Runtime Validation** - Automatic validation of serialized Annotation objects
  against type schemas
* **Versioning** - Independent versioning of vocabulary types separate from
  the MMIF specification
* **Machine-Readable** - JSON Schema generation and IDE support through
  Pydantic

Purpose
-------

MMIF is a JSON-LD based format for representing multi-modal annotations
on multimedia content. The CLAMS Vocabulary serves as the controlled
vocabulary layer for "Annotation" objects in the MMIF serialization, defining:

1. **Annotation Types** - How to represent linguistic, visual, and audio
   annotations
2. **Document Types** - How to represent source documents (text, video,
   audio, images)
3. (planned) **Controlled Vocabularies** - Enumerated value sets for constrained
   properties
4. (planned) **Task Types** - Definitions for processing content analysis tasks 
   (NLP, CV, etc) and their general input/output relationships

Architecture
------------

Pure Python Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Earlier versions of the CLAMS Vocabulary were published as part of the MMIF
specification in YAML format. The new implementation (as of 2026) uses pure
Python with Pydantic models. Benefits include:

* Single source of truth for types and validation
* No separate schema generation step
* IDE autocomplete and type checking
* Runtime validation with clear error messages

Versioning Strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each vocabulary type maintains independent versions:

* **Archetype** - The current/desired state (human-edited)
* **Snapshots** - Immutable historical versions (auto-generated)

When a type changes, the build system generates a new version snapshot,
ensuring backward compatibility with older MMIF files.

Using the Vocabulary
--------------------

For detailed usage instructions including import patterns, type resolution,
comparison behavior, and property aliases, see the :doc:`usage` guide.

Integration with mmif-python SDK
--------------------------------

The vocabulary integrates with mmif-python for MMIF serialization and
deserialization. For integration details and migration guides, see
the `mmif-python documentation <https://clams.ai/mmif-python/>`_.
