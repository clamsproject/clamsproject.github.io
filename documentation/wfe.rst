Workflow Engine
===============

The CLAMS project previously provided a `Galaxy <https://galaxyproject.org/>`_-based workflow engine for orchestrating CLAMS apps. This service was hosted at ``appliance.clams.ai``.

As of Summer 2025, this service is no longer maintained and has been taken down.

We are currently exploring new solutions, based on new advancements in AI utilization models, for a more flexible workflow engine. Please check back here for future updates.

If you have specific needs or suggestions for a workflow engine, please feel free to reach out to us at admin@clams.ai.
