The CLAMS project aims at providing archivists and media researchers with an open platform to access and explorer archival audiovisual material to extract insightful metadata as well as computer scientists and developers of content analysis tools with an interoperable platform to integrate their tools for custom workflows and pipelines. 

The project is under active development. Contact us for any concerns or suggestions at [admin@clams.ai](mailto:admin@clams.ai).
